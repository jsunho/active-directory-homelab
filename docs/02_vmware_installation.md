In this part of my homelab project, I documented how i installed VMware Workstation Pro and prepared a virtual machine for Windows Server 2022. This is the base for everything I will do later, like Active Directory, DNS, GPO, and other Windows Server roles.

## 1. Installing VMware Workstation Pro

I downloaded it from the Broadcom website. Before downloading, I had to create a Broadcom account, but the registration was free.

After logging in, I selected VMware Workstation Pro 25H2 for Windows and downloaded the installer. When the download finished, I ran the executable and installed the program by clicking through the setup with the default settings. The installation took a few minutes.
