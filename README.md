# active-directory-homelab
A small virtual lab that sets up an on-premises Active Directory domain with a domain controller, Windows client, and basic enterprise features: OUs, users, groups, Group Policies, and file shares with proper permissions. The project is fully documented and reproducible on a single host machine.
